For a complete end-to-end walk-through of creating this application, please refer to the [Bot Builder SDK for Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-overview)
This sample is based on https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/Node/intelligence-LUIS

## Register your bot with Microsoft
Go to https://dev.botframework.com/bots and create a new bot.
Give it a name and enter the application insights values from the initial resource deployment

## Deploying this sample
1. Deploy the arm template in arm/template.json to azure

It will deploy the following resources
- Azure Web App
- Logic App
- Application Insights
- Azure Search
- Cosmos DB
- LUIS API
- Bing Spell API
- Azure Function
- Code from github to the WebApp
- Configuration from all resource to environment variables in the web app and function

## Prepare your blank azure vm for development

1. Open Internet Explorer (does not work on Chrome) and paste the following URL: 

http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denniszielke/hackbotsimple/master/scboxstarter.txt

2. Click Run on the security warning. 
3. Click Run again when prompted. 
4. This will take about 5 minutes and does the setup of prerequired software: Visual Studio Code, NodeJs, Git, Google Chrome, Fiddler4

## Set the environment variables for local dev test
1. Download the bot framework emulator from https://emulator.botframework.com/ 
2. Create an .env file by renaming the .env_template file and fill in the variables 

## Create a LUIS app and import the app
1. Go to https://luis.ai/ and import the file from the luis/LuisBot.json
2. Train the model and publish it
3. Insert the LUIS key from the arm template deployment into your app keys
4. Update the LUIS_MODEL_URL environment variable inside .env file with your published model url
